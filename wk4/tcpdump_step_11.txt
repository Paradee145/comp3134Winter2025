Command:
sudo tcpdump -i any -w capture_output.pcap

Explanation:
This command captures packets from any available interface and writes them to a binary file named 'capture_output.pcap'. 
This file can later be opened in Wireshark for deep packet inspection or read using:
    sudo tcpdump -r capture_output.pcap
