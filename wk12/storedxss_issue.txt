The stored XSS issue happens when user input containing malicious script is saved on the server (e.g., in a file or database) and then displayed without any sanitization.

In this lab, the storedxss.txt file contains a script:
<script>document.location.href="/directory_traversal_part1.php"</script>

When storexss.php loads this file and displays its content without filtering, the browser runs the script. This can redirect the user, steal cookies, or execute harmful actions.

This makes stored XSS more dangerous than reflected XSS because it runs every time the page loads.
