Step H: Securing Comments in Source Code

- HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) are visible in browser "View Source," exposing sensitive data.
- PHP comments (`// ...` or `/* ... */`) are **not** visible in the source code when viewed in a browser.
- This prevents attackers from easily discovering internal credentials or secrets.
