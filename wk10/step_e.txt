Step E: Secure Directory Traversal Fix

- Used realpath() to ensure users cannot access directories outside /var/www/html.
- Used file_exists() to verify that the requested folder exists before scanning.
- Used is_file() to prevent accessing files instead of directories.
- The script now blocks directory traversal attempts using '../' or encoded paths.
- This prevents attackers from viewing system files outside the web directory.
