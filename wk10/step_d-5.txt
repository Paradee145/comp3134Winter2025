What I see on the browser:
The script decodes the encoded path and still allows traversal to a parent directory. It shows the contents of the folder above the web root.

What sensitive information is given by this page:
Even with URL encoding, the server reveals internal files and directories. This can be used by attackers to bypass filters and explore sensitive areas of the file system.
